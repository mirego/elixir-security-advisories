  ### Impact
  
  DOS by Atom exhaustion is possible by calling `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_provider_configuration/1` or `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_jwks/1`.
  
  Since the name is usually provided as a static value in the application using `oidcc`, this is unlikely to be exploited.
  
  ### Details
  
  Example to illustrate the vulnerability.
  
  ```erlang
  {ok, Claims} =
    oidcc:retrieve_userinfo(
      Token,
      myapp_oidcc_config_provider,
      <<"client_id">>,
      <<"client_secret">>,
      #{}
    )
  ```
  
  The vulnerability is present in `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_ets_table_name/1`.
  The function `get_ets_table_name` is calling `erlang:list_to_atom/1`.
  
  https://github.com/erlef/oidcc/blob/018dbb53dd752cb1e331637d8e0e6a489ba1fae9/src/oidcc_provider_configuration_worker.erl#L385-L388
  
  There might be a case (Very highly improbable) where the 2nd argument of
  `oidcc_provider_configuration_worker:get_*/1` is called with a different atom each time which eventually leads to
  the atom table filling up and the node crashing.
  
  ### Patches
  
  Patched in `3.0.2`, `3.1.2` & `3.2.0-beta.3`
  
  ### Workarounds
  
  Make sure only valid provider configuration worker names are passed to the functions.
