  ### Impact
  
  The use of `Plug.Session` in `Pow.Plug.Session` is susceptible to session fixation attacks if a persistent session store is used for `Plug.Session`, such as Redis or a database. Cookie store, which is used in most Phoenix apps, doesn't have this vulnerability.
  
  ### Workarounds
  
  Call `Plug.Conn.configure_session(conn, renew: true)` periodically and after privilege change. A custom authorization plug can be written where the `create/3` method should return the `conn` only after `Plug.Conn.configure_session/2` have been called on it.
