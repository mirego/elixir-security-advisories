  ### Summary
  
  Queue deletion via the HTTP API was not verifying the `configure` permission of the user.
  
  ### Impact
  
  Users who had all of the following:
  
  1. Valid credentials
  2. Some permissions for the target virtual host
  3. HTTP API access 
  
  could delete queues it had no (deletion) permissions for.
  
  ### Workarounds
  
  Disable management plugin and use, for example, [Prometheus and Grafana](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/prometheus) for monitoring.
