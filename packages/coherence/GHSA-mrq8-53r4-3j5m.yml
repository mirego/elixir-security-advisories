description: An issue was discovered in Steve Pallen Coherence before 0.5.2 that is similar to a Mass Assignment vulnerability. In particular, "registration" endpoints (e.g., creating, editing, updating) allow users to update any coherence_fields data. For example, users can automatically confirm their accounts by sending the confirmed_at parameter with their registration request.
