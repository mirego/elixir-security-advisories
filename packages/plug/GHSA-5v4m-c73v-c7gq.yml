description: |-
  The default serialization used by Plug session may result in code execution
    in certain situations. Keep in mind, however, the session cookie is signed
    and this attack can only be exploited if the attacker has access to your
    secret key as well as your signing/encryption salts. We recommend users to
    change their secret key base and salts if they suspect they have been leaked,
    regardless of this vulnerability.
