description: |
  Plug.Static is used for serving static assets, and is vulnerable to null
    byte injection. If file upload functionality is provided, this can allow
    users to bypass filetype restrictions.
    We recommend all applications that provide file upload functionality and
    serve those uploaded files locally with Plug.Static to upgrade immediately
    or include the fix below. If uploaded files are rather stored and served
    from S3 or any other cloud storage, you are not affected.
